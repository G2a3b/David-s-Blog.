      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro">I'm a little baby boy and I'm a little bit noisy, but it's normal for my age....I think...😁
      In general, I like so much to sleep 😴 to play 😊 to yell 😈 and to walk 😄. <br>
    It's one more thing... I love my parents so much.🥰 </p>

        <h3>First summer together.</h3>
        <p>In the 1st month of summer I was christened. Yeah, that's how I started the first summer of my life. It was an interesting event for me..🤔
         All those people had their eyes on me. I feeled like a superstar.😎
         Anyway, the first summer was amazing. I stayed on grandparent's terrace, I've looked to the flowers they hang over there. I've looked to the sky.</p>

        <h3>First Christmas in 3.</h3>
        <p> First Christmas for me was a pure magic.
          I saw more trees with mini lights. Santa Claus left me a gift, that's what my mom told, but interesting is that I was awake that night,but I didn't saw him..I don't know what to believe..🙄
        Anyway, Christmas is my favourite.</p>
